# Run 3 Triple-Quarkonia Analysis Master Plan

Date: 2026-03-29

Analysts:
- Chi Wang
- Xing Cheng (`Endymion2288`)

Physics channels in scope:
- `JpsiJpsiUpsilon -> 6mu`
- `JpsiJpsiPhi -> 4mu + 2K`
- `JpsiUpsilonPhi -> 4mu + 2K`

Working milestones requested by the analysis team:
- `2026-04-01 12:00 Europe/Zurich`: report slide decks ready
- `2026-04-02`: individual analysis reports delivered
- `2026-04-29`: internal flagship-analysis milestone for first official efficiencies and first component-separation result
- `2026-05-20`: bachelor thesis nearly complete in writing, even if the full final analysis result is not yet frozen
- `2026-08-31`: flagship-analysis freeze target for review-grade summer maturity
- `November 2026`: projected pre-approval month, exact week to be fixed with the review chain

## 1. Executive Summary

This program is already beyond the "idea stage". There is now clear evidence of active reconstruction code, MC production, ntuple production, validation studies, fit-oriented workspaces, and channel-specific analysis paths across local EOS areas and GitHub repositories. The most mature common analysis backbone is the refactored `TPS-Onia2MuMu` package inside `CMSSW_15_0_15_JpsiJpsiPhi_refactor`, with additional dedicated work in `MuonPackedPFCandMatch`, `ParticleCand`, `ntuples-toHTCondor`, the `JpsiUpsPhi` production-and-hadd area, and the gen-level `JpsiJpsiPhi_MiniAOD_GenAnalyzer`.

The key strategic conclusion is that the updated schedule is realistic only if the work is tiered against the real deadlines now in hand:
- `2026-04-01 12:00 Europe/Zurich` and `2026-04-02` are status-and-direction deadlines, not result deadlines.
- `2026-05-20` is a thesis-writing deadline, not a full-analysis freeze.
- `November 2026` is the review deadline for a pre-approval-grade flagship result.

The recommended channel strategy is therefore:
- `JpsiJpsiPhi` should remain the flagship near-term channel for the `2026-04-29` and summer freeze milestones.
- `JpsiJpsiUpsilon` should be kept as the MC-rich and six-muon-methods secondary channel.
- `JpsiUpsilonPhi` should be treated as an actively maintained secondary channel with stronger production-assembly maturity than was apparent in the first pass, especially on the 2022-2024 ntuple-merging and trigger-inspection side.

The most important CMS-style adjustment is to define the near-term deliverable as:
- baseline corrected yields or fiducial cross sections for the lead channel
- plus component separation by likelihood or template fit
- plus efficiency and closure validation

rather than promising a fully mature "unfolding" program for all three channels at once. In CMS language, the immediate task is better described as `component separation plus acceptance-times-efficiency correction`, not a full detector unfolding, unless differential observables are explicitly introduced.

### 1.1 Updated Hard Deadlines

- `2026-04-01 12:00 Europe/Zurich`: slide decks ready for the next-day reporting cycle
- `2026-04-02`: each analyst delivers a report on status, blockers, and next technical steps
- `2026-04-29`: internal technical milestone for first official efficiency objects and first flagship component-separation result
- `2026-05-20`: bachelor thesis text nearly complete, with methods, datasets, workflow, and preliminary physics material stable
- `2026-08-31`: flagship-analysis freeze target for the first review-grade package
- `November 2026`: projected pre-approval month

## 2. Evidence-Based Current Status

### 2.1 Shared reconstruction and ntupling backbone already exists

The strongest common code base is:
- `CMSSW_15_0_15_JpsiJpsiPhi_refactor/src/HeavyFlavorAnalysis/TPS-Onia2MuMu/`

What is already present there:
- multi-channel `AnalysisMode` support for `JpsiJpsiPhi`, `JpsiJpsiUps`, and `JpsiUpsPhi`
- refactored runtime-configurable object and mass cuts
- dataset and operations notes
- validation test planning
- active CRAB tooling for recent run eras
- dirty working state in exactly the files expected for ongoing analysis development:
  - `README.md`
  - `interface/MultiLepPAT.h`
  - `src/MultiLepPAT.cc`
  - `test/ConfFile_cfg.py`
  - `test/runMultiLepPAT_MCRun3_miniAOD_Run2022.py`
  - new `doc/` content and `test/crabScript_New/`

This means the main analyzer is alive and still evolving, not frozen.

### 2.2 Muon-to-packed-candidate validation is already a dedicated subproject

There is a separate repository and CMSSW package:
- `CMSSW_15_0_15_JpsiJpsiPhi_refactor/src/HeavyFlavorAnalysis/MuonPackedPFCandMatch/`
- GitHub remote: `Eric100911/MuonPackedPFCandMatch`

Already demonstrated:
- dedicated analyzer, notebook, and technical note
- smoke-tested on both MC and data
- one-event and O(10^3)-event debug outputs already present locally
- matching diagnostics for several matching definitions

This is important because it reduces one of the major detector-object risks for low-pt multi-muon analyses. It is not yet the final physics result, but it is exactly the kind of object-level validation that CMS internal review expects.

### 2.3 Strong local evidence of data and MC production

`JpsiJpsiPhi` local status:
- `rootNtuple/ParkingDoubleMuonLowMass[0-7]/crab3_noTriVtx_*_Run2025C...G_MINIAOD` directories already exist
- GEN-level, HepMC, miniAOD, and ntuple directories exist under `MC_samples/`
- local test outputs exist for:
  - `test_JpsiJpsiPhi.root`
  - `test_JpsiJpsiUps.root`
  - `mymultilep_JpsiUpsPhi_dataRun2023D.root`
  - `mymultilep_JpsiUpsPhi_mcRun2022_TPS.root`

`JpsiJpsiUpsilon` local status:
- very substantial MC preparation under `JpsiJpsiUps/MC_samples/`
- DPS, SPS, and TPS directories exist across LHE, HepMC, GENSIM, miniAOD, and root ntuple stages
- dedicated TPS miniAOD and ntuple outputs already exist
- `ParticleCand` repo is active on branch `6mu-roofit`
- `ntuples-toHTCondor` repo exists and is versioned
- many six-muon preselection and candidate-level files already exist

`JpsiUpsilonPhi` local status:
- `rootNtuple/ParkingDoubleMuonLowMass[0-7]/crab3_*_Run2023C/D_MINIAOD` directories already exist
- CMSSW no-triple-vertex area exists
- `rootNtuple/` contains `hadd_2022.sh`, `hadd_2023.sh`, `hadd_2023_half.sh`, and `hadd_2024.sh`
- `rootNtuple/` also contains `gen_hadd_2022.sh`, `gen_hadd_2023.sh`, and `gen_hadd_2024.sh` for campaign-level assembly command generation
- `viewTrigger.C` and `viewTrigger.h` exist for trigger-content inspection on merged ntuples
- local output files such as `mymultilep.root`, `mymultilep_Run2023_looseMassRange.root`, and `sample_JUP_2023.root` exist

Interpretation:
- `JpsiJpsiPhi` looks strongest on common framework maturity and already-visible 2025 ntuple production.
- `JpsiJpsiUpsilon` looks strongest on MC preparation and exploratory six-muon downstream analysis.
- `JpsiUpsilonPhi` is stronger on run-era production assembly than the first pass suggested, especially on the 2022-2024 merge workflow and trigger inspection side, though it is still less integrated than `JpsiJpsiPhi` in the shared refactored analysis framework.

### 2.4 GitHub-side work split is already visible

Shared reconstruction repo:
- `Eric100911/TPS-Onia2MuMu`
- local branch: `refactor`
- recent commits include:
  - fixing 2025 muon JSON handling
  - user proxy handling
  - major refactor completion
  - CRAB helper integration

Authorship signal from the local repo history:
- strong contributions from both `Eric100911` and `Endymion`
- merge of `Endymion2288/Dev-J-J-P` into the shared repo is already visible in the local history
- `Endymion` commits in the shared code base include adding `fromPV` and `pvQuality`, a new test program, and follow-up repository repair
- this is the clearest sign that the main reconstruction pipeline is already collaborative

Muon packed-candidate validation repo:
- `Eric100911/MuonPackedPFCandMatch`
- currently driven mainly by Chi Wang

Six-muon downstream candidate repo:
- `Eric100911/ParticleCand`
- active branch `6mu-roofit`
- recent commits indicate:
  - RooFit restructuring
  - candidate storage in ROOT
  - branch cleanup and six-muon analysis evolution

Xing Cheng public workspace repos:
- `Endymion2288/JpsiJpsiPhi-workspace`
- `Endymion2288/JpsiJpsiUps-workspace`
- `Endymion2288/JpsiUpsPhi-workspace`

Recent commit messages show work on:
- drawing pipeline
- first-edition fit pipeline
- adding `Lxy` pieces and a "Stefanos cut"
- bootstrapping `JpsiJpsiUps` workflow from the `JpsiUpsPhi` work

Additional workflow evidence consistent with Xing's production role:
- `Endymion2288/JpsiUpsPhi-workspace` is much larger than the other two public workspaces
- the matching local `JpsiUpsPhi/rootNtuple/` area contains year-specific `gen_hadd` and `hadd` workflows for 2022, 2023, and 2024
- trigger-inspection helpers exist in the same area and read branches such as `MatchUpsTriggerNames`
- the `gen_hadd_2024.sh` script auto-generates merge commands from CRAB-style directory patterns, which is stronger evidence of campaign-level production handling than a simple hand-written one-off merge
- the concrete `hadd_2023_half.sh` and `hadd_2024.sh` scripts enumerate run-era and stream-specific merges across all `ParkingDoubleMuonLowMass[0-7]` streams

Interpretation:
- Xing's visible work is not only fit and plot development; there is also strong evidence of production-assembly and ntuple-merging workflow maturity, especially on the `JpsiUpsPhi` side
- Chi's visible GitHub work is strongest on CMSSW analyzer, object validation, production tooling, and MC-side infrastructure
- this is a good division of labor and should be made explicit instead of leaving it implicit

### 2.5 Xing's newer MC-production and gen-level repositories materially strengthen the status picture

Additional relevant repositories inspected:
- `Endymion2288/Full_MC_Production`
- `Endymion2288/JUPMCAnalyzer`
- `Endymion2288/JJP_MINIAOD_Analysis`
- `Endymion2288/TPS-Onia2MuMu`

`Endymion2288/Full_MC_Production` now provides the strongest explicit MC workflow evidence seen so far:
- a DAGMan generator for full-chain production from `LHE -> shower -> mix -> GEN-SIM -> RAW -> RECO -> MiniAOD -> ntuple`
- campaign definitions for both `JJP` and `JUP`, with SPS, DPS, and TPS topologies
- a universal `run_chain.sh` wrapper that handles LHE-pool resolution, Pythia showering, event mixing, CMSSW production, and EOS transfer
- explicit `ntuple_jjp_cfg.py` and `ntuple_jup_cfg.py` configs showing integration with JJP and JUP ntuple analyzers
- clear deployment assumptions across `CMSSW_12_4_14_patch3`, `CMSSW_14_0_18`, HTCondor, EOS, and containerized el9 execution for the ntuple stage

Recent commit evidence for `Full_MC_Production`:
- `2025-12-23`: `feat: first edition of LHE2MINIAOD`
- `2025-12-27`: `fix: successfully test`

`Endymion2288/JUPMCAnalyzer` shows a dedicated JUP MiniAOD truth-analysis layer:
- FWLite-based gen-correlation analysis for `SPS`, `DPS_1`, `DPS_2`, `DPS_3`, and `TPS`
- xrootd-based batch reading of campaign outputs
- plotting scripts and HTCondor submission flow
- recent commit `2026-01-14`: `feat: use HTCondor`

`Endymion2288/JJP_MINIAOD_Analysis` shows the corresponding JJP truth-analysis layer:
- MiniAOD truth-analysis for `SPS`, `DPS_1`, `DPS_2`, and `TPS`
- explicit iteration on topology definitions and parton-relation logic
- HTCondor support and multiprocessing updates
- recent commits include:
  - `2025-12-27`: `feat: change eta to y and use multiprocessing`
  - `2026-01-09`: `feat: strictly limit the parton process`
  - `2026-01-09`: `fix: do not limit parton relation in TPS`
  - `2026-01-14`: `feat: use HTCondor`

`Endymion2288/TPS-Onia2MuMu` remains useful as context:
- it documents the shared origin of the onia-analysis code and explicitly lists Chi and Xing as contributors
- its README is older and more `JpsiJpsiUpsilon`-oriented, but it still confirms that Xing's work is tied to the common analyzer lineage rather than being only external post-processing

Interpretation:
- Xing's role is now clearly broader than fit support or ad hoc merging; it spans full MC production design, truth-level topology studies, HTCondor execution, and downstream MiniAOD-based validation
- this materially strengthens the credibility of the JJP and JUP MC programs, especially for near-term efficiency, closure, and SPS/DPS/TPS template studies
- the immediate collaboration need is no longer to discover whether MC infrastructure exists, but to align the definitions and outputs of these repos with the shared `TPS-Onia2MuMu` analysis baseline

### 2.6 Gen-level study infrastructure already exists for JpsiJpsiPhi

Repo:
- `Eric100911/JpsiJpsiPhi_MiniAOD_GenAnalyzer`

The README clearly documents:
- gen-level correlation studies from MiniAOD
- SPS, DPS, and TPS mode handling
- plotting scripts
- HTCondor setup
- xrootd-based batch running

This is a major asset for:
- template construction
- truth-category closure tests
- acceptance studies
- DPS/TPS interpretation

### 2.7 The main gaps today

The project is advanced, but several items are still not yet in a review-ready state:

- There is no single frozen baseline selection and ntuple schema for all three channels.
- The `TPS-Onia2MuMu` and `MuonPackedPFCandMatch` repos are still dirty locally, so the code state used for large-scale efficiency production is not yet frozen.
- `ParticleCand` contains many untracked files, macros, and ROOT outputs, which means the six-muon downstream chain is not yet fully reproducible from a clean checkout.
- `JpsiJpsiPhi` shows 2025 ntuple production locally, but `JpsiUpsilonPhi` does not yet show comparable 2024-2025 top-on in the same way.
- The new GitHub MC repositories still need a formal cross-check against the shared refactored analyzer so that campaign labels, topology definitions, cuts, and ntuple schemas mean the same thing everywhere.
- No unified response or efficiency production campaign is yet visible across all three channels.
- No explicit systematic-uncertainty registry is visible yet.
- No single "master note" yet ties together the three channels, the MC definitions, the fit models, the efficiency scheme, and the review path.

## 3. Recommended Physics Strategy

### 3.1 Measurement definition

For each channel, the minimal physics product should be:
- a fiducial signal yield or upper limit
- an acceptance-times-efficiency corrected yield
- a component-separated interpretation in terms of SPS, DPS, and possibly TPS

Near-term, the analysis should not over-promise a fully differential unfolding. Instead:
- use `component separation fit` for SPS/DPS/TPS-like contributions
- use acceptance and efficiency corrections for fiducial measurements
- reserve full detector unfolding for later only if a differential observable becomes central

### 3.2 Channel prioritization

Recommended prioritization as of `2026-03-29`:

Tier A, flagship:
- `JpsiJpsiPhi`

Tier B, secondary but active:
- `JpsiJpsiUpsilon`: strongest on MC depth and six-muon downstream development
- `JpsiUpsilonPhi`: strongest on run-era production assembly, hadding workflow, and trigger-inspection maturity

Reasoning:
- `JpsiJpsiPhi` still has the best evidence of an integrated path from gen study to 2025 data ntuple production and the shared refactor work.
- `JpsiJpsiUpsilon` remains the most mature secondary channel from the point of view of MC breadth and six-muon-specific downstream analysis.
- `JpsiUpsilonPhi` should no longer be treated as merely exploratory; it has meaningful workflow maturity, but should not outrun `JpsiJpsiPhi` on shared-framework stabilization unless the staffing split makes that efficient.

### 3.3 Thesis-level versus note-level deliverables

For the bachelor-thesis-level milestone on `2026-05-20`, the cleanest deliverable is:
- a nearly complete thesis text covering motivation, datasets, code architecture, object definitions, MC strategy, bookkeeping, and workflow status
- preliminary flagship-channel plots and, if available in time, first corrected or partially corrected flagship results
- supporting status plots and technical progress for the secondary channels

For the later note and pre-approval path:
- extend to full systematics
- incorporate additional certified data
- freeze a flagship result by late summer
- upgrade secondary channels from exploratory or support status to publication-quality only if the statistics and fit stability justify it

## 4. CMS-Style Analysis Workstreams

### 4.1 Workstream A: Scope, bookkeeping, and reproducibility

Tasks:
- freeze channel definitions, trigger menus, run eras, JSONs, global tags, and branching fractions
- create one bookkeeping table per channel
- tag the code states used for each production and result milestone
- enforce one script or command block per official plot and table

Deliverables:
- reproducible run cards
- dataset ledger
- git tags or frozen commit hashes
- one master note section for bookkeeping

Why CMS cares:
- review discussions fail quickly if the exact code, inputs, and conditions are ambiguous

### 4.2 Workstream B: Object and reconstruction validation

Tasks:
- finalize muon ID working points per channel
- finalize kaon track selection for phi reconstruction
- validate trigger matching behavior for all channels and run eras
- validate vertex quality, duplicate candidate handling, and no-triple-vertex behavior
- finalize the role of the packed-candidate study in the baseline object definition

Deliverables:
- channel-by-channel control plots for muon pt, eta, ID, and vertex probability
- dedicated note subsection explaining muon and track choices
- explicit decision on whether the packed-candidate study changes any baseline selection or only documents robustness

Why CMS cares:
- rare multi-object analyses live or die on object-definition trust

### 4.3 Workstream C: Data processing and ntuple production

Tasks:
- unify CRAB or condor submission patterns across channels
- ensure each channel has a clean ntuple naming convention
- close run-era coverage gaps
- explicitly separate test outputs from production outputs

Deliverables:
- one standard directory layout
- one production checklist per run era
- ntuple inventory table with event counts and integrated luminosities

### 4.4 Workstream D: MC truth definition and efficiency production

Tasks:
- define truth labels for SPS, DPS, and TPS hypotheses per channel
- standardize generator-level, miniAOD-level, and reconstructed-level category definitions
- build acceptance maps
- build reconstruction and selection efficiencies
- perform closure tests from truth to reconstructed categories

Deliverables:
- per-channel efficiency tables
- response matrices or template-transfer objects
- closure plots

Why CMS cares:
- correction factors without closure studies are not review-safe

### 4.5 Workstream E: Signal extraction and component separation

Tasks:
- define observables for separating:
  - combinatorial background
  - non-prompt or displaced backgrounds where relevant
  - SPS-like
  - DPS-like
  - TPS-like contributions
- build the first simultaneous fit model
- compare cut-based and fit-based stability
- document low-statistics protections and fallback models

Candidate observables:
- invariant masses
- vertex probability
- decay length or `Lxy`
- pair or system rapidity separations
- opening angles or `DeltaPhi`
- per-resonance or system pt

Deliverables:
- first fit workspace
- fit validation on toy MC or bootstrap resamples
- sideband and alternative-model studies

### 4.6 Workstream F: Cross section extraction

Tasks:
- define the fiducial phase space clearly
- compute corrected yields
- convert to fiducial cross sections
- define the conventions for `sigma_eff,DPS` and `sigma_eff,TPS`
- verify that the chosen formulas and symmetry factors are documented clearly

Deliverables:
- cross-section formula sheet
- one note subsection with all definitions
- cross-check with toy examples and units

### 4.7 Workstream G: Systematics

Required sources to consider:
- luminosity
- trigger efficiency
- muon reconstruction and identification
- track and kaon reconstruction
- vertexing and fit-quality cuts
- MC model dependence
- generator composition for SPS, DPS, TPS
- fit model choice
- mass-shape parameterization
- background parameterization
- limited MC statistics
- data period dependence
- pileup if applicable
- duplicate removal and event cleaning

Deliverables:
- systematic registry with owner, method, and status
- impact table
- nuisance implementation list for the final fit if needed

### 4.8 Workstream H: Documentation and review preparation

Tasks:
- maintain one live analysis note from now onward
- write methods in parallel with coding, not after the plots are done
- keep a standard validation appendix
- prepare weekly one-page progress snapshots

Deliverables:
- analysis note draft
- plot index
- reproducibility appendix
- pre-approval backup deck

Why CMS cares:
- pre-approval timing is determined as much by documentation maturity as by physics maturity

## 5. Role Split Recommended Right Now

### 5.1 Chi Wang should lead

- CMSSW analyzer freeze for `TPS-Onia2MuMu`
- data and MC ntuple production bookkeeping
- trigger, JSON, global-tag, and run-era consistency
- packed-candidate and object-validation closure
- MC production chain consistency

### 5.2 Xing Cheng should lead

- full-MC DAG and campaign-definition documentation for `JJP` and `JUP`
- truth-level MiniAOD analyzers and topology-validation studies for `JJP` and `JUP`
- fit framework
- drawing and post-processing pipeline
- `JpsiUpsPhi` campaign assembly, ntuple-merging, and trigger-workflow documentation
- `Lxy` and selection optimization studies
- channel-level signal and background shape comparisons
- component-separation notebooks or scripts

### 5.3 Joint ownership

- final selection freeze
- efficiency parameterization
- systematic choices
- thesis milestone sign-off
- analysis note writing

### 5.4 Reserved Progress-Tracking Scope

This document should be updated directly by both analysts at least once per week.

Required editable blocks:
- the live trackers in Section `1.2`
- milestone status updates in Section `7`
- week-completion notes in Section `9`

Minimum update rule:
- each of Chi and Xing should mark at least one `Done`, one `In progress`, and one `Blocked` item whenever the tracker is updated during active analysis periods

## 6. What Should Be Done Immediately

These are the highest-priority next actions, with the first two tied directly to the `2026-04-01 12:00` and `2026-04-02` deadlines.

### 6.1 Complete the report sprint

Action:
- prepare and freeze slide decks by `2026-04-01 12:00 Europe/Zurich`
- deliver status reports on `2026-04-02`

Required content:
- one current-status slide per channel
- one slide on code and workflow readiness
- one slide on blockers and immediate next steps
- one slide defining the flagship channel and the thesis strategy

Reason:
- the next reporting checkpoint should be used to align scope, not to pretend the analysis is already review-grade

### 6.2 Freeze the lead and secondary scopes

Action:
- officially declare `JpsiJpsiPhi` as the flagship channel
- explicitly classify `JpsiJpsiUpsilon` and `JpsiUpsilonPhi` as active secondary channels with different strengths

Output:
- one written scope statement and one responsibilities table

Reason:
- without a written scope split, the thesis and summer plans will keep fighting each other

### 6.3 Freeze one reconstruction baseline in git

Action:
- clean and tag the code state for:
  - `TPS-Onia2MuMu`
  - `MuonPackedPFCandMatch`

Output:
- frozen commit hashes for April production

Reason:
- efficiency studies must not be launched on a moving target

### 6.4 Build one bookkeeping table for every channel

Must include:
- datasets
- run eras
- JSONs
- global tags
- trigger paths
- MC campaign names and topology definitions
- source repository or script that defines each MC campaign
- ntuple output paths
- integrated luminosity target
- current status

Reason:
- this will immediately expose missing 2024-2025-2026 coverage and stop accidental double-counting
- it will also reveal where GitHub MC definitions and the shared analyzer baseline are already aligned, and where they are not

### 6.5 Run a three-channel validation matrix

Minimum matrix:
- `JpsiJpsiPhi` on lead MC and one representative data file
- `JpsiJpsiUpsilon` on lead MC and one representative data file
- `JpsiUpsilonPhi` on lead MC or best available proxy and one representative data file

Checks:
- branch filling
- candidate multiplicities
- trigger-match flags
- fit success rate
- runtime and output size

Reason:
- you need an apples-to-apples readiness comparison before promising one-month delivery across channels

### 6.6 Turn the MC into efficiency products, not just event samples

Action:
- define and produce the first official truth-to-reco efficiency objects:
  - acceptance
  - reconstruction efficiency
  - selection efficiency
  - trigger efficiency if not factorized separately

Reason:
- this is the core of the April milestone

### 6.7 Start the first fit workspace now

Action:
- Xing leads a first compact fit for the flagship channel using the currently strongest observable set

Expected first target:
- background versus signal separation
- then SPS-like versus DPS-like separation
- TPS-like only if statistics and template stability justify it

Reason:
- fits always take longer than expected; waiting for "perfect inputs" will miss the milestone

### 6.8 Start thesis-writing structure immediately

Action:
- prepare the thesis chapter skeleton now, before the physics result is final

Must include:
- motivation and context
- dataset and trigger bookkeeping
- software and CMSSW workflow
- MC strategy
- efficiency plan
- current preliminary results section with clearly marked placeholders

Reason:
- the `2026-05-20` thesis deadline is driven by writing maturity, not only by analysis maturity

### 6.9 Decide what the packed-candidate study changes in the baseline

Action:
- write a one-page decision note:
  - does `MuonPackedPFCandMatch` only validate robustness?
  - or does it change the baseline muon or candidate treatment?

Reason:
- this study is valuable, but it must either become analysis policy or remain a validation appendix

### 6.10 Start the master note immediately

Action:
- keep one living note file with:
  - scope
  - dataset table
  - object definitions
  - fit strategy
  - efficiency plan
  - systematics registry

Reason:
- this is the single biggest lever for making the November pre-approval target plausible

## 7. Evaluation of the Updated Milestones

### 7.1 Milestone 1: `2026-04-01 12:00 Europe/Zurich`

Requested outcome:
- slide decks ready for the Thursday report

Assessment:
- `Green`

CMS-style interpretation:
- fully realistic if this is a status-and-plan deliverable
- unrealistic only if treated as a demand for polished physics results

Recommendation:
- emphasize:
  - current maturity of each channel
  - the flagship decision
  - concrete blockers
  - the April and May work plan

### 7.2 Milestone 2: `2026-04-02`

Requested outcome:
- individual analysis reports delivered

Assessment:
- `Green/Yellow`

Why it is plausible:
- the requested content is primarily organizational and technical
- the code and workflow evidence is already strong enough to support a credible report

Why it is risky:
- it becomes risky only if the report overclaims final-result readiness

Recommendation:
- make the report explicit about:
  - what is already demonstrated
  - what is under active development
  - what is still only planned

### 7.3 Milestone 3: `2026-04-29`

Requested outcome:
- first official flagship efficiencies and first component-separation result

Assessment:
- `Green/Yellow` for one flagship channel
- `Red/Yellow` for all three channels at equal maturity

CMS-style interpretation:
- realistic if this means a first corrected flagship measurement with closure tests and a working template fit
- unrealistic if this means full three-channel precision extraction with finalized systematics and harmonized all-era inputs

Recommendation:
- define April 29 as:
  - frozen flagship selection
  - first efficiency maps
  - first component-separation fit
  - first corrected yield or fiducial cross section for `JpsiJpsiPhi`
  - progress-only status for the secondary channels

### 7.4 Milestone 4: `2026-05-20`

Requested outcome:
- bachelor thesis nearly complete in writing

Assessment:
- `Green/Yellow`

Why it is plausible:
- the thesis does not need the full final analysis result to be frozen by that date
- much of the thesis can and should be completed from now through early May:
  - motivation
  - datasets and triggers
  - software structure
  - analysis methodology
  - MC workflow
  - efficiency strategy
  - current status and preliminary plots

Why it is risky:
- it becomes risky if writing is delayed until the analysis is "done"
- it also becomes risky if all three channels are forced into equal narrative weight

Recommendation:
- by May 20, the thesis should be missing only:
  - final polished result wording
  - final systematic tables
  - possibly final conclusion emphasis

### 7.5 Milestone 5: `2026-08-31`

Requested outcome:
- flagship-analysis freeze for the first review-grade package

Assessment:
- `Yellow`

Why it is plausible:
- this gives the project the whole summer to mature the flagship channel
- it is a much healthier freeze point than trying to jump directly from a thesis deadline to a November pre-approval

Why it is risky:
- scope creep from the secondary channels can still destabilize the flagship package
- summer systematics and fit-robustness work may expand

Recommendation:
- treat late August as the real physics freeze, with autumn reserved for review hardening

### 7.6 Milestone 6: `November 2026`

Requested outcome:
- pre-approval

Assessment:
- `Yellow`

It is plausible only if all of the following happen:
- the flagship result is frozen by late August
- the note is mostly written by September
- secondary channels do not create late-stage scope creep
- review plots, closure tests, and systematics tables are already in place well before November

CMS-style warning:
- pre-approval is rarely blocked by only one missing plot; it is usually delayed by a combination of:
  - moving selection
  - unclear correction scheme
  - incomplete note
  - missing robustness checks

Recommendation:
- work backward from the pre-approval target and treat late August as the real freeze month

## 8. Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Why it matters | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope creep across three channels | Three rare channels can easily become three half-finished analyses | Freeze `JpsiJpsiPhi` as flagship now |
| Moving code baseline | Efficiency and systematic studies become invalid if the code keeps shifting | Tag production states in git |
| Fragmented downstream workflow | Six-muon and fit studies may become irreproducible | Consolidate exploratory macros into tracked scripts |
| 2026 data dependence | Availability and certification are not fully under analyst control | Keep 2026 top-on as stretch until certified |
| Fit instability at low yields | DPS/TPS separation may be statistically fragile | Start with simplest stable model and add complexity only after closure |
| Late systematic explosion | Common in rare processes once the fit is frozen | Build the systematics registry in parallel starting now |
| Weak documentation pace | Pre-approval can slip even with good plots | Write note sections every week |

- stable flagship note draft
- secondary channels clearly classified as either full-scope or supporting-scope

### 10.5 By `November 2026`

Required:

## 11. Final Recommendation

The collaboration should treat the next three days as a `report-and-scope sprint`, the next seven weeks as a `thesis-and-flagship-method sprint`, the summer as a `flagship-analysis freeze sprint`, and autumn as `review hardening`. That is the most realistic way to satisfy the fixed writing deadlines while still protecting a credible November 2026 pre-approval target.

The current evidence already supports optimism:
- reconstruction code is real and active
- data and MC production already exist
- fit-oriented work has started
- Xing's visible role now includes explicit full-chain JJP/JUP MC production and MiniAOD truth-analysis repositories, not only downstream fitting or merge scripts
- the Chi/Xing skill split is complementary

The main danger is not lack of work. It is lack of scope control.

If scope is controlled now, this can become a credible CMS-style analysis program. If scope is not controlled now, the project risks reaching May with a stressed thesis schedule and reaching autumn with many interesting intermediate products but no review-safe flagship result.
